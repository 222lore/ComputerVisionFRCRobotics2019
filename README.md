# Targeted Vision

Copyright (c) 2019 Arman Bhalla. All Rights Reserved.

I, the Author (Arman Bhalla) of this project and all code, files, and ideas therewith, provide this project as free open-source software (FOSS), under such terms that any user, deployer, or observere of
of this repository of code must, in summary:

1. Read the license accompanied in the root folder of this project. At all times this original LICENSE and README file should remain in the root
of all projects that this is included in (i.e, ``/LICENSE.txt``, not ``/x/LICENSE.txt``). This license is subject to change and must be updated subsequently in the root of the project.

2. All modifications should remain completely open source and credited to the Author (Arman Bhalla). The README of the final product should link to this repository in plain text (not hyperlinked). 
Any files or documentation should be kept under the same name (do not rename README.md to, say, README-vision). For instance: ``https://github.com/techtide/ClientVisionCode/``.

3. Any and all modifications of the code should remain under the original attribution. Not to be used in closed-source projects.

4. Any and all deployments of the code should be visually viewable somewhere in the final product and by due terms listed in the license. For embedded systems, 

5. This was not created under the supervision or partnership with or for any institution, organization, body, or group.
All work and modifications done under this project should, as stated in summary points 2 and 3, belong to me and not be accredited to anyone else, institution, body or group. A deployment of slightly adjusted code or the same code is not considered difference. 

6. This product is provided as is without any guarantee or warranty. Failiure to work under causes of modification or deployment on other systems is considering the fault of the user and not the Author (Arman Bhalla).

By using this software, you (on behalf of all people in your groupp, organization, or institution) vow to read and accept the FOSS license (provided in LICENSE.txt), follow all clause listed in this document, the README (README.md), and are naturally obliged to do so.
Failiure to comply with any and all terms listead in the LICENSE and this file can result in potential [legal] problems (see Free Software Foundation), but more so, a lot of shame. Hard work goes into creating open-source projects and code like this. 
Anything you use without accrediation is massive shame to you and your organization; FOSS is made to make the world and the internet a better place, that is its cause. The Free Software Foundation itself states this.
